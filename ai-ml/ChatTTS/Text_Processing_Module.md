## Component Details

The `Text Processing Module` is a critical subsystem responsible for preparing raw input text for the speech synthesis pipeline. It ensures that the text is linguistically sound and converted into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models. This module comprises two fundamental components: the `Text Normalizer` and the `Text Tokenizer`.

### Text Normalizer
This component, implemented by the `ChatTTS.norm.Normalizer` class, is responsible for the linguistic pre-processing of raw input text. Its primary functions include standardizing punctuation (e.g., converting various symbols to a consistent set), applying character mappings (e.g., half-width to full-width conversions), performing homophone replacement to resolve ambiguities, and removing invalid characters. It also includes language detection to apply language-specific normalizations. The goal is to ensure the text is clean, consistent, and correctly interpreted before tokenization, which is crucial for accurate pronunciation by the speech synthesis model.

### Text Tokenizer
This component, implemented by the `ChatTTS.model.tokenizer.Tokenizer` class, serves as the interface between human-readable text and the numerical representations required by the machine learning models. It takes the normalized text and converts it into numerical token IDs and corresponding attention masks using a pre-trained `BertTokenizerFast`. Conversely, it can also decode sequences of token IDs back into human-readable text. It handles special tokens relevant to the ChatTTS model, such as `[spk_emb]` and `[break_0]`.
