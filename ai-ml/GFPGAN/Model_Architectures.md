## Details

The GFPGAN architecture is centered around the `GFPGANv1` component, which orchestrates a comprehensive face restoration pipeline. This pipeline heavily relies on the `StyleGAN2GeneratorClean` for its robust style-based image synthesis capabilities, where components like `ModulatedConv2d` and `ToRGB` are fundamental for generating and rendering high-quality images. Complementing this GAN-based approach, the `RestoreFormer` component provides a distinct transformer-based pathway for general image restoration, utilizing `MultiHeadEncoder` and `MultiHeadDecoderTransformer` for efficient feature processing and resolution management via `Downsample` and `Upsample` operations. This dual-component strategy allows GFPGAN to address a wide range of image restoration challenges effectively.

### GFPGANv1
Implements the end-to-end GFPGANv1 generator, specifically tailored for high-fidelity face restoration. It orchestrates multiple sub-components to form a comprehensive generative pipeline, integrating both StyleGAN2 principles and residual learning. This component is central as it represents the primary face restoration model.

### StyleGAN2GeneratorClean
Provides a clean and modular implementation of the StyleGAN2 generator. Its core function is style-based image synthesis through modulated convolutions, serving as a fundamental generative building block that can be used independently or as part of larger architectures. It is a foundational generative model.

### RestoreFormer
Defines a transformer-based architecture specifically designed for general image restoration tasks. It leverages attention mechanisms to effectively process and restore image features, offering an alternative or complementary approach to GAN-based restoration. This component represents a distinct, non-GAN-based restoration approach.
