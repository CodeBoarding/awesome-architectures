## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### CLI Layer [[Expand]](./CLI_Layer.md)
Serves as the primary user interface for the `crush` application. It is responsible for parsing command-line arguments, subcommands, and user input, validating them, and translating them into structured, actionable requests that are then delegated to the `Crush Core` for processing. This layer acts as the entry point for all user interactions with the application.

- `internal/cmd.schemaCmd` (1:1)


### Crush Core
The central processing unit of the `crush` application. It receives structured requests from the `CLI Layer`, orchestrates the execution of core business logic, and interacts with other internal components to fulfill user commands. This component is responsible for the main functionality and data processing within the application.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `internal/app.App` (1:1)


### Configuration Manager
Manages the application's configuration settings. It is responsible for loading, parsing, and providing configuration data to other components, including the `CLI Layer`. This ensures that the application operates with the correct settings and can adapt to different environments or user preferences.
