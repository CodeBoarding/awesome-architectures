## Details

The Keras library's core architecture is built around the Model and Layer abstractions. The Model serves as the top-level container for neural networks, orchestrating the flow of data through various Layer components. Sequential models offer a simplified, linear stacking of Layer instances, while more complex, pre-built architectures like DenseNet subclass Model to encapsulate sophisticated network structures. Individual Layer implementations, such as Dense (fully connected), BaseConv (convolutional), RNN (recurrent), and MultiHeadAttention (attention mechanism), inherit from the base Layer class, providing specialized computational units. The Model composes and invokes these Layer instances to perform forward passes, training, and evaluation. Sequential models aggregate Layer instances in a defined order, and DenseNet (and similar application models) also compose various Layer types to form their specific architectures. This hierarchical structure allows for flexible and modular construction of neural networks.

### Model
The core abstraction for defining a neural network. It acts as a container for layers, manages the model's graph, and provides methods for training, evaluation, and prediction.
