## Details

This subsystem focuses on the core mechanisms for model optimization and loss calculation within the project. It centralizes the creation of various optimizers through an `OptimizerFactory`, allowing for flexible integration of algorithms like `LarsOptimizer`, `LAMBOptimizer`, and `AdamW`. A `Lookahead` meta-optimizer can wrap these to enhance performance. These optimizers are responsible for updating model parameters based on gradients derived from loss functions. The system includes general `Losses` for quantifying prediction errors and specialized functions like `YoloLoss` for domain-specific tasks. The `create_optimizer` utility further streamlines optimizer setup, often incorporating learning rate schedules, demonstrating how optimization is integrated into specific application domains.

### OptimizerFactory
Acts as the central factory for instantiating various optimization algorithms, abstracting the creation process and providing a unified interface for creating different optimizer instances. This is crucial for a toolkit, promoting reusability and extensibility by centralizing optimizer creation.
