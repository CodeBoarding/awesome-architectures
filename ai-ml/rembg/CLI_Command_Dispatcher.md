## Component Details

This component serves as the primary user interface for command-line interactions. It is responsible for parsing user input, managing application version display, and dispatching commands to their respective processing logic. It acts as the initial entry point and orchestrator of user-driven workflows, delegating specific tasks to individual command modules.

### CLI Entry Point
The main entry point for the `rembg` command-line application. It uses the `click` library to define the root command group, handles version display, and dynamically registers all available subcommands. It's the initial orchestrator of user-driven workflows.

### Command Registry
A central module that collects and exposes all individual command functions (e.g., `b_command`, `i_command`). It acts as a directory for the CLI Entry Point, allowing it to easily discover and register all available commands, promoting extensibility.

### Byte Stream Command
Implements the `b` command, specifically designed to process image data provided as a byte stream (e.g., via standard input). It parses command-line options related to model selection, alpha matting, and output formatting, then delegates the core background removal task to the Background Removal Core.

### File Input Command
Implements the `i` command, which handles background removal for images specified by file paths or standard input. It manages command-line arguments and options, then passes the image data to the Background Removal Core for processing.

### Background Removal Core
The fundamental component responsible for executing the actual background removal algorithms. It takes an image and a session object (which encapsulates the chosen model) and performs the necessary operations to separate the foreground from the background. This is the core functionality of the `rembg` application.

### Session Factory
Manages the creation and retrieval of processing sessions, each configured with a specific background removal model. This component abstracts away the complexities of model loading and ensures that the correct model is efficiently provided to the command handlers for image processing.
