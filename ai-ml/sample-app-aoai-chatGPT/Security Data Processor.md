## Component Details

This graph illustrates the components involved in processing user security data. The `Security Data Processor` orchestrates the extraction of security information, primarily leveraging `MS Defender Utilities` to gather details from various sources. The extracted data is then structured and stored within the `User Security Context` component, providing a standardized representation of the user's security posture.

### Security Data Processor
Handles the extraction and processing of user security-related information from various sources, such as Microsoft Defender, to populate a structured user security context.

### MS Defender Utilities
This component provides utility functions for interacting with Microsoft Defender-related security aspects. Its primary function, `get_msdefender_user_json`, is responsible for extracting relevant user security details from authentication information and request headers to construct a User Security Context.
