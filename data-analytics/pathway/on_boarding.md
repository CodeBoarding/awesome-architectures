## Details

Pathway is a high-performance data processing framework designed for real-time data pipelines. It comprises a user-friendly Python API for defining data transformations, which are then compiled and executed by an optimized Rust-based engine. Data ingress and egress are managed by dedicated I/O connectors, interacting with various external data systems. A Python-based graph execution engine orchestrates the interaction between the Python API and the Rust core, while a control and observability layer provides tools for managing and monitoring pipelines. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for flexible pipeline definition in Python and efficient, incremental execution in Rust.

### External Data Systems
Represents all external data sources (e.g., Kafka, S3, Postgres, GDrive, Airbyte, HTTP, SharePoint) and sinks (e.g., Postgres, Delta Lake, HTTP). This is a conceptual component representing external systems that Pathway interacts with, and thus does not have direct source code within the Pathway project. Its interaction is facilitated by the `Pathway I/O Connectors`.

### Pathway Graph Execution Engine (Python) [[Expand]](./Pathway_Graph_Execution_Engine_Python_.md)
Compiles the logical dataflow graph defined by the Pathway Python API into an executable plan and orchestrates its execution on the Pathway Rust Execution Engine. This component acts as the primary interface to the Rust engine.

### Pathway Rust Execution Engine
The high-performance, incremental computation engine written in Rust. It executes the compiled dataflow graph received from the `Pathway Graph Execution Engine (Python)`. As this component is written in Rust, its source code is external to the Python project.
