## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Configuration Management [[Expand]](./Configuration_Management.md)
This component is responsible for managing both server-side and workspace-specific configurations. It receives configuration updates from the LSP client via the `LSP Communication Layer` and then provides these settings to other internal components, such as `Feature Implementations` and the `Semantic Analysis Engine`, to influence their behavior and adapt to user preferences or project-specific requirements.
