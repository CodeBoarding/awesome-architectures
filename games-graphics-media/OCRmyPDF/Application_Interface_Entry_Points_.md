## Component Details

This subsystem serves as the primary user-facing layer of OCRmyPDF, handling all initial interactions, whether through the command-line interface (CLI) or a programmatic API. It is responsible for parsing inputs, validating them, and orchestrating the initiation of the OCR processing workflow.

### CLI Entry Point
This component is the primary interface for users interacting with OCRmyPDF via the command line. It is responsible for parsing command-line arguments, validating initial inputs, and setting up the environment for the OCR processing workflow. It acts as the initial gateway for all terminal-based user interactions.

### API Entry Point
This component provides a programmatic interface, allowing other Python applications or scripts to integrate and utilize OCRmyPDF's functionalities. It handles API calls, validates the provided inputs, and directly initiates the core OCR processing pipelines.

### CLI Pipeline Orchestrator
This component acts as an intermediary specifically for the command-line execution flow. Its main responsibility is to prepare the necessary command-line options and the plugin manager, then delegate the execution to an exception-handling wrapper. This ensures that the core OCR process, when initiated from the CLI, is always run within a controlled and error-resilient environment.

### Exception Handling Wrapper
This component is critical for the application's stability and user experience, particularly for CLI operations. It acts as a protective wrapper around the core OCR pipeline, catching various types of exceptions (e.g., KeyboardInterrupt, ExitCodeException, PIL.Image.DecompressionBombError, process pool errors). It translates these exceptions into user-friendly error messages printed to stderr and ensures the program exits with appropriate non-zero exit codes, facilitating robust scripting and automation.

### Core OCR Pipeline
This component encapsulates the core functionality of OCRmyPDF, responsible for performing the actual OCR processing on PDF documents. It takes the prepared options and plugin manager to execute tasks such as image preprocessing, text recognition, and PDF manipulation. It is the functional heart of the application, performing the primary value-add operation.
