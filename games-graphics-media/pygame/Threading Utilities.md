## Component Details

The `threads` module provides utilities for parallel processing using threads. It includes a `WorkerQueue` class for managing a pool of worker threads and a `tmap` function for applying a function to a sequence in parallel. The `FuncResult` class is used to store the result of a function call, including any exceptions. The `benchmark_workers` function helps determine the optimal number of worker threads for a given task.

### threads
The `threads` module serves as a container for the threading utilities, providing a central location for accessing the `WorkerQueue`, `tmap`, `FuncResult`, and `benchmark_workers` components.

### WorkerQueue
The `WorkerQueue` class manages a pool of worker threads, distributing tasks among them for parallel execution. It uses a queue to hold tasks and provides methods for adding tasks, waiting for completion, and stopping the workers. It initializes worker threads upon creation and manages their lifecycle.

### tmap
The `tmap` function provides a simple interface for parallelizing the application of a function to a sequence of elements. It leverages the `WorkerQueue` to distribute the work across multiple threads, returning a list of the results. It handles the submission of tasks to the queue and retrieves the results.

### FuncResult
The `FuncResult` class is a data structure for encapsulating the result of a function call, including any exception that may have occurred during execution. It allows the `tmap` function to capture and propagate exceptions from worker threads.

### benchmark_workers
The `benchmark_workers` function is designed to determine the optimal number of worker threads for a given task by measuring the performance of different `WorkerQueue` configurations. It creates and stops `WorkerQueue` instances with varying numbers of workers to assess their impact on performance.
