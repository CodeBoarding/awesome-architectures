## Component Details

Abstract Components Overview of Spleeter

### Separator
The `Separator` class is the core component for performing audio source separation. It initializes and manages a TensorFlow `Estimator` for model inference, handles loading model configurations and weights, and provides methods for separating audio waveforms. It abstracts the complexities of the underlying machine learning model and its execution, offering a high-level interface for users to perform separation. It can also leverage multiprocessing for concurrent separation tasks.

### AudioAdapter
The `AudioAdapter` component is responsible for abstracting audio input/output operations. It provides methods to load audio waveforms from various sources (e.g., files) and save separated audio tracks to specified destinations with different codecs and bitrates.

### ModelProvider
The `ModelProvider` component is responsible for locating and providing access to the pre-trained TensorFlow models used for separation. It ensures that the `Separator` can find and load the necessary model checkpoints from their respective storage locations.

### Estimator
The TensorFlow `Estimator` is a high-level TensorFlow API that simplifies machine learning programming. In Spleeter, it's used by the `Separator` to perform the actual inference (prediction) of separated audio sources based on the loaded model. It manages the TensorFlow graph and session for execution.

### InputProviderFactory
The `InputProviderFactory` is responsible for creating an `InputProvider` instance, which prepares the input data (waveforms) into a format suitable for the TensorFlow `Estimator`. This involves handling audio descriptors and converting them into a dictionary of features that the model expects.
