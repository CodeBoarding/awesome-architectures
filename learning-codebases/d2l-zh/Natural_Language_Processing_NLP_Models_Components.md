## Component Details

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models & Components subsystem is a critical part of the project, providing a comprehensive suite of tools and models for processing and understanding text data. Its modular design, with distinct components for vocabulary management, token embeddings, attention mechanisms, and advanced models like Transformers and BERT, allows for flexible and efficient development of NLP applications across different deep learning frameworks.

### Vocabulary Management
This foundational component is responsible for building and managing the vocabulary from raw text. It handles tokenization (breaking text into words or subword units) and mapping these tokens to unique numerical indices, which is an essential preprocessing step for any neural network-based NLP model.
