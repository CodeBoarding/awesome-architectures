## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### CLI Interface [[Expand]](./CLI_Interface.md)
Offers a command-line utility for direct user interaction with the email verification functionality. It parses command-line arguments, orchestrates the verification process by invoking the Email Verification Core, and presents results to the user. It also interacts with the ConfigurationManager to retrieve necessary settings.
