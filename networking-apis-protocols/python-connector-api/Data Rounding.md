## Component Details

The Data Rounding component focuses on providing a mechanism to round numerical data within Pandas DataFrames to a specified precision. This ensures data consistency and facilitates easier analysis by controlling the number of decimal places. The core functionality revolves around the `round_df` function, which iterates through DataFrame columns, identifies numeric ones, and applies rounding based on the `get_num_decimal_places` function.

### round_df
This function rounds a Pandas DataFrame to a specified number of decimal places. It iterates through the columns of the DataFrame and applies rounding to numeric columns. It uses the `get_num_decimal_places` function to determine the number of decimal places to round to for each column.

### get_num_decimal_places
This function determines the number of decimal places to round to based on the data type of the input. If the input is a float, it calculates the number of decimal places. If it's not a float, it returns 0. This function is used by `round_df` to determine the appropriate precision for rounding.
