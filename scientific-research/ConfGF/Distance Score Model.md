### GraphIsomorphismNetwork
The GraphIsomorphismNetwork (GIN) component implements a type of Graph Neural Network designed to process and learn representations from graph-structured data. It consists of multiple convolutional layers that iteratively update node and graph features. This component is crucial for extracting meaningful features from the molecular graphs, which are then used by the DistanceScoreMatch model for score estimation.

### MultiLayerPerceptron
The MultiLayerPerceptron (MLP) component is a fundamental feed-forward neural network used as a versatile building block throughout the ConfGF subsystem. It comprises multiple linear layers with optional activation functions and dropout. MLPs are utilized for various transformations, including processing input features, generating output scores, and as sub-components within the GraphIsomorphismNetwork's convolutional layers.
