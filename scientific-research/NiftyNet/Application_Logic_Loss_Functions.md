## Details

The NiftyNet application architecture is built around a core `BaseApplication` component, which establishes a standardized lifecycle for various medical imaging tasks. Specialized applications like `SegmentationApplication` and `ClassificationApplication` extend this base, tailoring the data pipeline and network integration for their specific domains. These applications interact with dedicated loss components, such as `LossSegmentation`, `LossClassification`, and `LossAutoEncoder`, which encapsulate the mathematical formulations for evaluating model performance. A shared `UtilityFunctions` component provides essential data preprocessing capabilities, which are leveraged by the loss functions to prepare data for computation. This modular design promotes reusability and clear separation of concerns, facilitating the development and extension of diverse medical imaging applications.

### BaseApplication
Defines the abstract interface and common lifecycle management (training, inference, evaluation states) for all NiftyNet applications. It ensures a standardized operational framework across different medical imaging tasks.
