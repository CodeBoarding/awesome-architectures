## Details

The Network Architectures (Model Zoo) subsystem in NiftyNet is responsible for providing a collection of pre-defined deep learning models and fundamental building blocks for constructing various network architectures, primarily for medical imaging tasks.

### UNet
Implements the U-Net convolutional network architecture, commonly used for biomedical image segmentation. It composes UNetBlocks, which in turn utilize fundamental layers.

### HighRes3DNet
Implements the HighRes3DNet architecture, designed for high-resolution 3D medical image analysis. It composes HighResBlocks, which utilize fundamental layers.

### DenseVNet
Implements the DenseVNet architecture, characterized by dense connectivity patterns for efficient feature reuse. It composes DenseFeatureStackBlocks, which utilize fundamental layers.

### DeconvLayer
A fundamental building block for N-dimensional deconvolution (transposed convolution) operations, typically used for upsampling in network architectures like U-Net.
