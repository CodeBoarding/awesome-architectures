## Details

The `Core Utilities` component serves as the foundational backbone for the entire project, providing a suite of highly reusable helper functions and modules.

### Cheminformatics Utilities
This module provides essential functions for handling molecular data, including operations like molecular similarity calculations, validation of chemical structures, and conversions between different molecular representations (e.g., SMILES, DeepSMILES). It directly supports the project's core domain.
