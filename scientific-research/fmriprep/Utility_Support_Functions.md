## Details

The `Utility & Support Functions` component in `fMRIPrep` is a critical collection of general-purpose helper modules that ensure code reusability, consistency, and simplified operations across the pipeline. While `getClassHierarchy` did not reveal a deep class structure, the file system analysis of `fmriprep/utils` clearly indicates distinct functional sub-modules, which serve as the fundamental components within this utility layer. These modules are essential for a Scientific Data Processing Pipeline as they encapsulate common, often complex, operations, promoting modularity and maintainability.

### BIDS Utilities
This module provides essential helper functions for interacting with BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) datasets. It includes functionalities for parsing BIDS entities from file paths, generating BIDS-compliant output paths, and potentially validating BIDS structures. Its role is fundamental in ensuring that `fMRIPrep` adheres to neuroimaging data standards for both input and output.

### Confound Management
Dedicated to the calculation, extraction, and management of physiological and motion-related confound regressors from fMRI data. These regressors are crucial for denoising and improving the statistical validity of fMRI analyses by accounting for non-neuronal signal fluctuations.
