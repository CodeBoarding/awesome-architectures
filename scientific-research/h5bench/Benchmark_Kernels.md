## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Core Execution Engine [[Expand]](./Core_Execution_Engine.md)
This component is responsible for orchestrating and initiating the execution of various benchmark kernels. It acts as the primary control flow mechanism, setting up the environment and invoking the specific I/O patterns and data access methods defined within the `Benchmark Kernels` component.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Benchmark Kernels [[Expand]](./Benchmark_Kernels.md)
This component encapsulates the core logic for simulating various I/O patterns and data access methods. It represents the actual workloads executed to interact with the underlying data management layer, primarily HDF5, and generate performance data. Each method within this component corresponds to a specific benchmark scenario or application-specific I/O pattern.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Data Management & I/O Utilities
This component provides a set of utility functions and interfaces for managing data and performing low-level I/O operations. It primarily abstracts interactions with underlying data storage technologies, such as HDF5, offering a consistent interface for the `Benchmark Kernels` to utilize for data access and manipulation.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_
