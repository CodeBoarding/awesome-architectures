## Details

The `psych.js` project is architected as a JavaScript Utility Library with a complementary Web Application Viewer. At its core, the Core Psychrometric Library provides the fundamental computational engine for psychrometric calculations, defining points, lines, and handling mixed airflows. The Viewer Application acts as the client-side graphical user interface, consuming the functionalities of the Core Psychrometric Library to visualize data and interact with psychrometric properties, while also relying on Static Assets for its visual presentation. Comprehensive Documentation supports both developers and users by describing the Core Psychrometric Library, the Viewer Application, and referencing the Static Assets, ensuring clarity and usability across the project.

### Core Psychrometric Library [[Expand]](./Core_Psychrometric_Library.md)
This component encapsulates the fundamental psychrometric calculation logic. It provides a set of functions and classes for defining psychrometric points, lines, and performing various calculations related to mixed airflows and psychrometric properties. It serves as the backend computational engine for the entire system.
