## Details

QBDI is a Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) framework designed for security research, reverse engineering, and dynamic analysis. At its core, the Virtual Machine (VM) Core orchestrates the entire instrumentation process, managing the target program's state and dispatching user-defined callbacks. It interacts with the Instrumentation Engine to dynamically analyze and transform native machine code into instrumented code, leveraging LLVM for advanced code generation. The Execution Manager handles the seamless execution of this instrumented code, managing memory blocks and controlling the program's flow. All these core functionalities rely on the System Abstraction Layer, which provides a unified interface to operating system and CPU architecture-specific services like memory management, context switching, and register state manipulation, ensuring portability. Higher-level Tooling & API Bindings (like Python bindings and preload injectors) are built on top of the VM Core's public API, extending QBDI's utility. Finally, Project Infrastructure components manage the build, testing, and documentation processes, supporting the framework's development and maintenance.

### Virtual Machine (VM) Core
The central orchestrator of QBDI. It initializes the instrumentation process, manages the target program's execution state, registers and dispatches user-defined callbacks, and coordinates the dynamic re-compilation and execution of code. It serves as the primary API interface for users.

### Execution Manager [[Expand]](./Execution_Manager.md)
Manages the dynamic execution environment, including the allocation and management of executable memory regions (execution blocks) where instrumented code resides. It also handles the seamless transition of control flow between the original application and the instrumented code, managing execution contexts and exceptions.
