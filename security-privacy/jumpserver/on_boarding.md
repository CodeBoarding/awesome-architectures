## Component Details

The architecture of `jumpserver` can be effectively understood through six core components, each playing a critical role in its functionality and security posture. These components are chosen for their distinct responsibilities and their central role in the system's data flow and control.

### Identity & Access Management (IAM)
The central authority for managing user identities, authentication mechanisms (local, LDAP, OAuth, MFA), and granular authorization policies (ACLs, RBAC). It also handles multi-tenancy through organizational units, ensuring users and resources are properly scoped. This component is fundamental as it dictates *who* can do *what* and *where* within the system.

### Asset & Credential Management
Responsible for cataloging and organizing all managed IT resources (hosts, databases, cloud assets) within a hierarchical node structure. It also manages associated credentials (accounts), including secret generation, rotation, and integration with external secret management systems. This component defines *what* resources Jumpserver manages and *how* it accesses them.

### Session & Command Control
Manages the entire lifecycle of interactive sessions (SSH, RDP, VNC, databases, web) between users and assets. It handles session establishment, real-time monitoring, command execution, and comprehensive session recording for auditing purposes. This is the primary operational interface, crucial for both access facilitation and real-time monitoring.

### Auditing & Compliance
Collects, stores, and provides access to detailed audit trails of all system activities, including user logins, session recordings, command executions, file transfers, and administrative operations. This is paramount for security, compliance, and forensic analysis, answering the question of *what happened*.

### Automation & Orchestration
Provides a robust framework for executing automated tasks across managed assets, such as asset discovery, password rotation, and custom playbooks (often leveraging Ansible). It manages task scheduling, execution, and logging, enabling efficiency and scalability.

### Platform Services & Integrations
A foundational layer providing system-wide configurations, a unified notification system (email, SMS, IM platforms), and a workflow-based ticketing engine for managing approval requests (e.g., temporary access). It ensures the system is configurable, extensible, and can communicate effectively with its environment and users.
