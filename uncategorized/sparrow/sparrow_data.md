## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Raw Data Ingestion
Responsible for the initial intake of raw data from various external sources. This module acts as the system's gateway for all incoming information, handling diverse input mechanisms.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Data Extraction & Parsing
Focuses on extracting meaningful information from the ingested raw data and parsing it into structured or semi-structured formats. This includes specialized tasks like text extraction, image analysis, or table recognition, often leveraging external inference capabilities.

### Inference Engine Abstraction
Provides a unified and consistent interface to various underlying machine learning inference engines (e.g., VLLM, MLX, HuggingFace). This module abstracts the complexities and specific APIs of different ML frameworks, allowing other `sparrow-data` modules to seamlessly leverage their processing capabilities.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Data Preparation & Standardization
Takes the parsed and extracted data and transforms it into a consistent, standardized format required by downstream ML pipelines. This involves data cleaning, normalization, and structuring to ensure compatibility and optimal performance for machine learning models.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_
