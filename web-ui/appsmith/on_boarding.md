## Details

This low-code/no-code platform facilitates application development through a visual UI Builder/IDE. Users define application logic and data interactions via Data & Action Management. When an application runs, the State Management component maintains its runtime state, dispatching actions that are processed by Data & Action Management. These actions often involve Query Execution Service to interact with external data sources, with all external communication routed through the API Gateway. Authentication & Authorization secures access to the API Gateway and other backend services. The AI Agent Service provides intelligent assistance throughout the development process, interacting with both the UI Builder/IDE and Data & Action Management. Finally, Application Lifecycle Management oversees the deployment and operational aspects of the created applications.
