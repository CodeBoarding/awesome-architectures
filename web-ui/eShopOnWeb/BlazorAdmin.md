## Details

This analysis describes a .NET project architecture. Specific code references could not be provided as the available tools are for Python, and the project context (e.g., package name) was not supplied for a .NET codebase.

### ApplicationCore [[Expand]](./ApplicationCore.md)
Encapsulates the core business logic, domain models, and application services. It defines the interfaces for data access and external services, ensuring the business rules remain independent of infrastructure concerns.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Infrastructure [[Expand]](./Infrastructure.md)
Implements data persistence (e.g., Entity Framework Core with SQL Server) and integrates with external services. It provides concrete implementations for interfaces defined in ApplicationCore, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Web [[Expand]](./Web.md)
The primary presentation layer for the customer-facing e-commerce website, built with ASP.NET Core MVC/Razor Pages. It handles user requests, renders views, and interacts with ApplicationCore to fulfill business operations.
