## Details

The application's configuration management is centered around two key components: the Configurator and the Registry. The Configurator is responsible for processing configuration directives and building the application's operational structure by populating the Registry. Once populated, the Registry acts as the central, immutable repository for all application-wide settings and services, providing a consistent and reliable lookup mechanism for other components throughout the framework's runtime. This clear division of responsibility ensures that the application's behavior is driven by its configuration, with the Configurator establishing the foundational setup and the Registry maintaining it for subsequent use by the rest of the system.

### Configurator
The initial entry point for defining and applying application configurations. It processes declarative directives (e.g., routes, views, services) and actively populates the Registry with the resulting operational structure.

### Registry [[Expand]](./Registry.md)
The central, immutable repository for application-wide settings and registered components, providing a consistent lookup mechanism for other parts of the framework during runtime.
