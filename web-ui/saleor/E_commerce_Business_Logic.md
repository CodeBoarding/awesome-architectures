## Component Details

The `E-commerce Business Logic` subsystem is the operational core of the Saleor application, orchestrating all essential e-commerce functionalities. It is composed of ten fundamental components, each with distinct responsibilities, working in concert to manage the entire lifecycle of an online store's operations. These components were chosen because they represent the primary functional domains of any e-commerce platform, directly mapping to the description of the `E-commerce Business Logic` and the provided related files. They are fundamental as they encapsulate the data models, business rules, and operational logic necessary for processing sales, managing products, handling customers, and integrating with external services.

### Account Management
